# KF2-Util
A Small utility I made for my Kindle Fire 2 (Otter2)

hair loss, financial loss, privacy loss, security breaches, or other damage, and therefore must be done entirely

at your own risk. I am not responsible for your misuse of this tool. I am not responsible for bricked devices, 

Dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please do some research if

you have any concerns about features included in this Utility before using it! YOU are choosing to make these 

modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.

I used the root method from B1n4ry (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1886460) but stripped the code to include only what I needed.

The rest of the code I wrote myself.

I also used freedom-boot from hashcode(http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2100963) for bootloader unlocking

also SuperUser apk (I think it's chainfires I can't rememeber) and Xposed APK are not made by me, nor are the busybox binary's or the Kindle Drivers
